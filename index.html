			<p>This is an experiment that aims to study people's capacity to recognize and learn abstract categories from sequences of symbols. It is divided in three separate trials, each of which is comprised of a learning stage, one or more training stages (followed by feedback stages for as long as mistakes are made), a generalization stage and, finally, an explanation stage. It is important that you complete each trial on your own and without taking breaks between its stages (although it is recommended to rest for a couple of minutes after each trial). Navigation between stages is done through a sole, blue-bordered button at the bottom of the screen (much like the one in this page). Instructions for every stage will be shown at the top of the screen once the experiment has begun.</p>
			<p>A <b>category</b>, within the context of this experiment, is defined as a collection of boxes, each of which hold a sequence (of symbols) that satisfy certain criteria. For example, one category could be coomposed of all boxes holding sequences of three symbols or more that contain the subsequence &#x2606;&#x25A8;&#x2690;. The purpose of each trial is to get you to learn what constitutes its category.</p>
			<p>A trial will begin with a <b>learning stage</b> whose purpose is for you to find criteria that determines the trials' category by studying a slew of boxes with colored borders: a green border indicates that the box belongs to the trials' category, while a red border indicates that the box does not belong to the trials' category.</p> <!-- TODO: Show example for learning stage. -->
			<p>Once you feel you have found the necessary criteria, you can proceed to the first <b>training stage</b>, where you will be presented with a shuffle of the boxes exhibited in the learning stage and tasked with selecting those that belong to the trials' category. If you make any mistakes, you will be taken to a <b>feedback stage</b> where you will be shown your errors. You may then move on to a new training stage with a different shuffle, this process being repeated until you correctly perform the training task.</p>
			<p>After a correct selection is made in the training stage, you will be led to the <b>generalization stage</b>, where you will be shown a handful of new boxes and asked to select those that you think belong to the trials' category. Once that is done, you may proceed to the <b>explanation stage</b>, where you will be presented with a large box in which to provide a verbal explanation of the criteria you believe determines the trials' category.</p>
			<p>A trial ends when its explanation stage is over. The experiment ends when the third trial is over.</p>
